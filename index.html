			<!-- <p>I graduated from Rutgers with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2012. After months of job searching I took a job witha small company that worked on construction jobs with commercial buildings. My official title was called Design Engineer. After about a year and a half of doing HVAC calculations and AutoCad drawings, I realized I wasn't enjoying my life to the fullest so I quit. The Coding Bootcamp is the new door that opened in life and I'm ready to overcome all the obsticals to make this my new career. Can't wait to kill this course so I can become a baller and visit all my friends that live all over the world!</p  -->
