					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<img src="assets/images/china.jpg" class="image" alt="Muhammet Aydin ">
					<p>I graduated from Rutgers with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2012. After months of job searching I took a job with a small company that worked on construction jobs with commercial buildings. Long story short, I wasn't enjoying my life to the fullest so I quit. I went to China earlier this year to gain some prospective on what I want to do with my future. Like the Great Wall of China, the Coding Bootcamp is another difficult wall that I have to climb. I am ready for the challenege and can't wait to make this climb!</p>
					<p>My hobbies include playing sports, traveling to new places, and coding. After having knee surgery to repair my ACL, I used a lot of excuses to not work out. After about a year of inactivity, I have gotten back into it and things have been great. I love eating healthy and cooking my own meals. My goal is to reach my high school weight by the end of this program.</p>
